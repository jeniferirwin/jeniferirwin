My name is Jenifer Irwin. I'm an aspiring game developer who is currently learning Unity and C#. I solo-developed a game that was named 'Best Overall' in the Unity Create With Code Game Jam of 2020. The game was Chamber of Eternity: https://technitaur.itch.io/eternity

Two years later, I placed #1 again with Vindicta, Siren of Riffs! https://technitaur.itch.io/vindicta

My other skills include general system management and maintenance, with solid competence in both Windows and Debian-flavored Linux. I would loosely describe myself as capable of full-stack operations - for example, I'm capable of taking a completely blank hard drive, turning it into a functioning Windows or Linux server and configuring various services (ssh, apache, MySQL, etc.) with relative ease. I can pick up on how to perform pretty much any sysadmin task assuming that I'm given time to learn and access to Google. (That's how it be for pretty much all of us, right?)

I am interested in pursuing a remote work-from-home career in some kind of game development and/or possibly DevOps.
