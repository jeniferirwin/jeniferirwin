My name is Jenifer Irwin. I'm an aspiring game developer who is currently learning Godot. I had a stint of learning Unity for a few years before that. I solo-developed a game that was named 'Best Overall' in the Unity Create With Code Game Jam of 2020. The game was Chamber of Eternity: https://technitaur.itch.io/eternity

Two years later, I placed #1 again with Vindicta, Siren of Riffs! https://technitaur.itch.io/vindicta

My other skills include general system management and maintenance, with solid competence in both Windows and Debian-flavored Linux. I would loosely describe myself as capable of full-stack operations - for example, I'm capable of taking a completely blank hard drive, turning it into a functioning Windows or Linux server and configuring various services (ssh, apache, MySQL, etc.) with relative ease. I can pick up on how to perform pretty much any sysadmin task assuming that I'm given time to learn and access to Google. (That's how it be for pretty much all of us, right?)

If you contact me for work, it's a 'maybe,' as I'm now informally part of a gamedev studio and working on a game for real! I don't think I'm interested in anything full-time, but temporary odd jobs are still on the table.

Note: While I *can* do front-end web development, it's not something I particularly enjoy. I'd rather have my hands in your system's guts - not its skin.
