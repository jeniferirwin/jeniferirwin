My name is Jenifer Irwin. I also go by the handle 'technitaur' on most platforms. I'm an aspiring game developer who is currently learning Unity and C#. I solo-developed a game that was named 'Best Overall' in the Unity Create With Code Game Jam of 2020.

My other skills include general system management and maintenance, with solid competence in both Windows and Debian-flavored Linux. I would loosely describe myself as capable of full-stack operations - for example, I'm capable of taking a completely blank hard drive, turning it into a functioning Windows or Linux server and configuring various services (ssh, apache, MySQL, etc.) with relative ease. I can pick up on how to perform pretty much any sysadmin task assuming that I'm given time to learn and access to Google. (That's how it be for pretty much all of us, right?)

I am interested in pursuing a remote work-from-home career in some kind of game development and/or possibly DevOps. I think it might be fun to work for Unity themselves. If not Unity, then one of my favorite game companies... Hey, Todd Howard... You out there? Call me. 📞
